It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you
Ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh
Maybe won't you take it back? Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you
And I don't want to
Ooh
Up all night
On another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
I didn't mean to make you cry
I
Maybe won't you take it back? Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you
And I don't want to
Ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to
But I love you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
<p> Male Fantasy 
<img src="fantasy.jfif">
</p>Letras
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm going back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should but I could never hate you
<p>Die for you
<img src="die for you.jfif">
</p>letra Oh, baby
Oh, Los Angeles, I think I motherfucking love you, yeah

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time

I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Lets go one, two, three, sing

(Even though we're goin' through it)
(And it makes you feel alone)
(Just know that I) would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, Los Angeles, oh, baby
One more time
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I'd motherfucking kill for you, Los Angeles
One, two, one, two, three, sing

(Even though we're goin' through it)
(And it makes you feel alone)
Just know that I would die for you
(Baby, I would die for you, yeah) Sing
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
(Baby, I would die for you, yeah) Oh
One more time

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
